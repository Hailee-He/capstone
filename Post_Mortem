Post-Mortem (Reflection)

During development, one of my biggest challenges was finding assets that actually fit my game. I initially tried using AI-generated assets, but I ran into a lot of failures (inconsistent style, unusable outputs, and technical issues that created extra bugs). After that, I switched back to open-source / free asset libraries and focused on selecting art and audio that matched my design goals. I also learned to simplify my level art requirements so the game could stay consistent and achievable within my time and skill limits.

Another major lesson was audio. Adding music was not just “putting in a BGM”—I had to choose tracks that fit the character and tone of the game, and then implement them cleanly across scenes. This made me appreciate how an indie developer can reduce costs by using free resources carefully, while still aiming for a cohesive experience.

This project also taught me an important systems-thinking habit: design with implementation in mind from the beginning. I realized that starting with unrealistic ideas (“too ambitious, too many assumptions”) creates problems later. A more rigorous approach is to define a clear concept, plan systems that can actually be built, and then refine toward a personal style. Through this capstone, I gained a much stronger understanding of my game’s concept and how to build a fun experience under constraints—something players can understand quickly, learn fast, and enjoy.

If I had more time, I would improve the visuals (especially the backgrounds and player presentation) and expand the gameplay by adding more enemy variety and deeper interactions.
